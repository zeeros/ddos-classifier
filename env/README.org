* ANN for DDoS attacks detection - env
For each Kubeflow pipeline component we use a different image
- Dockerfile (base) :: Build a base image on which all other images
     are built on
- environment.yml :: Dependendencies for the conda environment,
     installed when the base image is built
- preprocess/, test/, train/ :: Build an image for specific
     components, containing all the code and data required
